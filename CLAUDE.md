# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A fully interactive puzzle game implemented in Python using Pygame with advanced merged tile mechanics. Players select an image, configure puzzle dimensions, and solve the puzzle by dragging and dropping tiles. When tiles are correctly placed adjacent to each other, they automatically merge into larger pieces that move together. Features include automatic tile merging, smart swap validation, win detection, solution hints, and smooth drag-and-drop mechanics.

## Running the Game

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the game
python main.py
```

## Architecture

### Game Flow
1. **Menu Screen** - User selects an image from the images folder
2. **Config Screen** - User inputs X and Y tile dimensions (2-20 range)
3. **Game Screen** - Puzzle is automatically shuffled; player drags tiles to solve

### Key Components

**main.py**
- `PuzzleGame` class manages overall game state using `GameState` enum
- Main game loop handles events, updates, and rendering
- State transitions between MENU → CONFIG → GAME → MENU

**screens/menu_screen.py**
- `MenuScreen` class displays available images as clickable buttons
- Automatically discovers images from the images folder
- Supports hover effects and click selection

**screens/config_screen.py**
- `ConfigScreen` class handles user input for tile dimensions
- Input validation ensures values are within MIN_TILES to MAX_TILES range
- Supports keyboard input, Tab/Enter navigation, and mouse interaction

**screens/game_screen.py**
- `GameScreen` class displays the puzzle with drag-and-drop and merged tile mechanics
- Individual tiles and merged groups can be dragged and swapped
- Detects merged groups when initiating drag operations
- Smart swap validation prevents invalid group swaps
- Renders merged tiles without internal borders (seamless appearance)
- `_draw_merged_group_borders()` - Draws perimeter borders around merged groups
- `_draw_dragging_group()` - Renders entire merged group while dragging
- `_draw_group_border()` - Helper to draw external borders only
- Visual feedback: hover effects, drag transparency, merged group highlighting
- Win detection automatically triggers when puzzle is solved
- UI controls: Shuffle, Restart, Solution (shows correct tiles in green)
- Keyboard shortcuts: S (shuffle), R (restart), Space (toggle solution), ESC (menu)
- Image is resized to fit screen while maintaining aspect ratio

**utils/image_utils.py**
- `get_available_images()` - Scans images folder for supported formats
- `load_image()` - Loads image from disk
- `resize_image_to_fit()` - Resizes while maintaining aspect ratio
- `create_puzzle_tiles()` - Subdivides image into a 2D grid of tiles
- `calculate_tile_display_rect()` - Calculates tile position with spacing

**utils/constants.py**
- Color definitions for UI elements (including drag, hover, win states)
- Screen dimensions and FPS settings
- Tile border width, spacing, and drag transparency
- Font sizes and UI element dimensions
- Game button dimensions for in-game controls

**utils/puzzle_logic.py**
- `PuzzleState` class manages tile positions, merged groups, and game logic
- `shuffle()` - Randomly shuffles tiles by performing random swaps
- `swap_tiles()` - Swaps two individual tiles at given positions
- `swap_groups()` - Swaps entire merged groups (validates size/shape matching)
- `is_solved()` - Checks if puzzle is in solved state
- `get_tile_at_position()` - Returns which original tile is at a position
- `get_correctness_grid()` - Returns grid showing correctly placed tiles
- `_update_merged_groups()` - Detects and tracks merged tile groups
- `_find_connected_correct_tiles()` - BFS algorithm to find connected correct tiles
- `get_group_containing_position()` - Returns merged group at a position (if any)
- `can_swap_groups()` - Validates if a group swap is possible (size/shape/bounds checking)

## Game Mechanics

### Merged Tile System
- **Automatic Merging**: Adjacent correctly placed tiles automatically merge into larger groups
- **Group Movement**: Merged tiles move together as one unit when dragged
- **Smart Validation**: Swaps only allowed between matching sizes:
  - Single tile ↔ Single tile: ✓ Allowed
  - Single tile ↔ Merged group: ✗ Blocked
  - Merged group ↔ Merged group (same size/shape): ✓ Allowed
  - Merged group ↔ Merged group (different size): ✗ Blocked
- **Visual Integration**: No borders between merged tiles, only around group perimeter
- **Progressive Solving**: Puzzle becomes easier as more tiles are correctly placed

### Drag and Drop
- Click and hold on any tile or merged group to start dragging
- Drag over another tile/group to attempt a swap
- Dragged elements become semi-transparent and follow the mouse
- Entire merged groups move together maintaining their relative positions
- Swap validation occurs on release - invalid swaps are prevented

### Puzzle State
- Puzzle is automatically shuffled when game starts
- Tile positions tracked using a 2D grid
- Merged groups dynamically updated after each swap
- BFS algorithm detects connected correctly placed tiles
- Win condition: all tiles are in their original positions

### Visual Feedback
- **Hover Effect**: Tiles/groups have blue borders when hovered
- **Drag Effect**: Dragged elements become semi-transparent with blue borders
- **Merged Groups**: Seamless appearance with only external borders
- **Solution Mode**: Press Space to highlight correctly placed tiles/groups in green
- **Win State**: Semi-transparent green overlay with victory message

### Controls
- **Mouse**: Drag tiles to swap positions, click buttons
- **S Key**: Shuffle the puzzle
- **R Key**: Restart (shuffle) the puzzle
- **Space Key**: Toggle solution mode (shows correct tiles)
- **ESC Key**: Return to main menu

## Image Handling

The game automatically handles images of varying dimensions:
- Images are resized to fit the screen while maintaining aspect ratio
- Spacing and borders are calculated to ensure tiles don't overflow the screen
- Supports JPEG, PNG, BMP, and GIF formats
- Tiles are extracted from the resized image and tracked independently
